# Portfolio

## Description
Hello! Welcome to the portfolio of mine. In this place, it contains some of my projects that I'm proud of. It tells you the languages I know how to use and gives you a tiny amount of power I contain in my hands and brain. It shows a little style too! Just so you know what kind of vibes I would be bringing to the team. I've got some games I've made, some animations, just a lot of things contained in this place is all I have to say!
